# UX

## Aim of website

The websites goal is to present an easily understandable quiz to the user accompanied with a brief description of the rules. The layout is designed to be as simplistic as possible for ease of use.

## Site creator aim

The aim is to consolidate my education on JavaScript, showcasing functionality, interactivity, proper syntax and code structure etc.

## User aim

The user should be able to navigate the site with great ease, understand the aim of the game aswell as how to play. If the user came away from the site understanding the rules and how well they scored I would consider the site a success.

## Site structure

The site consists of one page, an explanation of the rules of the game, followed by the game area (having a true or false button for each question, a start game button and a next question button) finally, at the bottom of the page there is a score-box letting the user know how many questions they have answered correctly at every point in the game.

# Features

## Game Title and Rules

The page has a clear Title indicating what the site is about, with clear instructions immediately below outlining how to navigate through the game features and the game's explicit purpose/rules.

## Game Area

The game area consists of 4 main features: the question area, the true or false question buttons, the start game button and the next question button. The start game button displays the first question provided in my questions array while the next question button loops through the next question one by one, all questions are displayed in the question area and are each checked whether they are true or false depending on which button the user decides to select.

## Score - Box

As each question answer is selected for every correct entry the score will be incremented by one, until every question has been presented to and answered by the user.

# Testing

* I used chrome developer tools throughout the project to test the site's responsivity.
* 

## Code Validation

* I ensured that the HTML code was validated using the [w3c code validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
* I ensured that the CSS code was validated using the [jigsaw validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

## Development Issues

* I initially struggled with how to structure my JavaScript properly but my mentor was able to help me overcome this issue.

* How to loop through the questions array one by one was a particulalry tricky function to write as the questions had to be displayed individualy I could not simply use a for loop to go through them another method had to be employed but aside from this there were little to no development issues.

# Deployment

The project was deployed on GitHub Pages. I used Gitpod as a development environment and also commited all of the changes to git version control system. I used the push command in Gitpod to save changes to GitHub.

### The deployment process

* Log into Git-hub and select my chosen repository to deploy.
* Go to settings and select Git-hub pages on the left hand side of the page.
* From the source select branch and then main branch.
* Finally save and then the website was deployed.

* "put link to website here"
* "potentially put 'how to run  locally' here aswell"
